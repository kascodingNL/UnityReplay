# UnityReplay
Replay system(like demo's in CS:GO), but for Unity games!


What the idea was/is, is to create a replay system like CS:GO, but for Unity, and freely available.

Since I adapted/made a system that works by subscribing to objects, it might be a bit more performance intensive, BUT it makes sure you can 
add objects to the replay mid-way through, which was simply not possible with my earlier iterations.

Documentation (hopefully) coming soon!
